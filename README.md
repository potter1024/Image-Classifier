# Image-Classifier

Implemented a 3 layered neural network using keras to make a multiclass image classifier.

Used the dataset from keras (cifar10 dataset of 60,000 images uniformly distributed into 10 classes)
Used 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing.

The performance i.e the F-value using precision and recall, calculated from comfusion matrix is 67.1%
